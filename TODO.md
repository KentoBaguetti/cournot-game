## My todo list so i remember where i left off

- create user mappings on the server side to map users to their respective game room
- keep adding maps -- users, gameRooms, activeGames, type shii
- migrate away from using socket.id's to using the jwt tokens -- should probably move them to cookies

- How to handle maintenence?

### What tools are being used:

- socket.io
- express
- jwt
- axios
- react
