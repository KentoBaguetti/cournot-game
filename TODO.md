## My todo list so i remember where i left off

- create user mappings on the server side to map users to their respective game room DONE
- keep adding maps -- users, gameRooms, activeGames, type shii DONE
- migrate away from using socket.id's to using the jwt tokens -- should probably move them to cookies ehh kinda done?
- handle reconnections DONE

- refactoring shii (can be later)
- move express routes into its own file
- socket.io endpoint bodies should be moved into a separate file as well

- How to handle maintenence?

### What tools are being used:

- socket.io
- express
- jwt
- axios
- react
