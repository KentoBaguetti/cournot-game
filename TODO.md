## My todo list so i remember where i left off

- handle reconnections semi done
- how to handle game time? have a timer run on the backend and if a timer is reached, force the frontend to continue? eg if a timer runs out, force a "null" player move

- refactoring shii (can be later)
- move express routes into its own file
- socket.io endpoint bodies should be moved into a separate file as well

- How to handle maintenence?
