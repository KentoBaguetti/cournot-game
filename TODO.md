## My todo list so i remember where i left off

- need to handle disconnections better, if a user reconnects to a game, the server should use the same player instance rather than make a new one
- if the host leaves the game, intentionally, from the game dashboard, the game instance should be deleted
- refactoring shii (can be later)
- move express routes into its own file

### What tools are being used:

- socket.io
- express
- jwt
- axios
- react
- uuied
